        <h6>3 May 2019</h6>
        
        <p>On the 21 Feburary 2019, I received my GCE A levels result. <em>It sucked.</em> I obtained a total score of 65rp, an IGP of DDC/B. What followed by was bawling my eyes out for following few days... 
        </p>
        
        <p> I was despodent and dumbfounded.</p>
        <p> What should I do? Should I settle on a private university? Should I retake as a private candidate? What if I don't improve even if i retook? What would others think of me? </p>
        <p>I've never thought that I would do this badly. I was not expecting a 65rp at all as I studied really hard for my As (or as if i thought so)</p>
        <p> After much self conflict, plastering myself on google search and hearing advices from several people, I came into a decision of retaking As. It wasn't an easy decision, but I realized I have to, rather than entering into an university course that i didn't have interest in, and then regretting it later in the future.</p>
        <p>Wow... man having to to plan for my revision was hell. I didn't even know where to start studying, but I am very blessed to have a supportive family and my partner who constantly motivate and encourage me.</p>
        
        <p>Fast forward to today, the 3rd month into re studying, I have completed the syllabus for Chemistry, 3/4 done with Math and Biology and have completed 3 TYS papers up to date.</p>
        
        <p>I want to prove to myself and people around me that <em>if you put your heart and soul into anything you want to accomplish, nothing is impossible.</em></p>
        
        <p>This blog will encompass my journey of overcoming failure</p>
